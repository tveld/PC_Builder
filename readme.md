#PC Builder Project
### Troy Veldhuizen

###Overview
The goal of this project is to explore the R programming language, and learn about data mining. 

###Problem this will solve
Because PC hardware improves at a rapid pace, it is hard to stay current on what the best deals are for PC components.  This system will mine current prices and performance for each component, and give an up to date report of the best deal.

###Scope
A complex interface is not needed, the focus is on learning how to sort data, not provide a complete end user product, maybe in the future:)

###Things to consider
Although a CPU may be the best money/performance tradeoff, a better system may use a less powerfull CPU and save more money for the GPU. In other words, each of the components in the system should not be considered independant of each other.

###Planning
1. Find data sources that are accessable, up to date, and detailed.
  - [Best Buy](https://bestbuyapis.github.io/api-documentation/#overview) seems to have the best API
  
2. Build data store.
3. Connect data store to R.
4. Talk to someone who knows statistics :)
